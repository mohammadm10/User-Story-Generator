# User-Story-Generator
This web application is designed to generate User Stories based on given requirements using OpenAI's language model. It provides a convenient way for users to create User Stories by making API calls to OpenAI.

The web application is built using the popular create-react-app framework for the frontend, and the backend is developed using TypeScript. At its core, the application leverages the power of OpenAI's language model to generate coherent and meaningful User Stories.

### How it Works
The application allows users to input their project requirements or prompts, and then makes a request to OpenAI's API to generate a User Story based on the given input. The User Story is displayed on the webpage, providing users with a clear and concise description of their project's desired features or functionality.

Since the backend is not deployed at the moment, all the functions necessary for generating User Stories are performed on the frontend. This means that the application operates solely within the user's browser, without any communication with a server.
